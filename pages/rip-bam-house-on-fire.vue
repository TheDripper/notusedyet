    <p>I lived in Oakland for 10 years and about 1.5 of them were spent on Mead Ave. This was 2013, so the Bay Area Housing Crisis was seeing its first wave. I was getting freelance webdev jobs off craigslist by exaggerating my skills on Skype and then googling PHP syntax all night. I needed cheap rent.</p>
    <p>At this point I was a 21 year old white kid from Burlingame, so the first time I turned the corner and parked on Mead, my adrenaline was surging. There were 2 or 3 clusters of big, tall, serious-looking black men, sitting on their porch or listening to music by their car. I got out and started looking for the address I'd found on the internet, and within a couple seconds a woman behind me shouted "Hey!".</p>
    <p>I jumped and turned around, certain that I'd pissed someone off and they wanted me to go back to my side of town.</p>
    <p>"You're gonna get a ticket if you park there, it's street sweeping today." It was an older lady in the top window of the house I'd parked in front of. I noticed the other window had a painting in it: it was a surreal and beautiful portrait of a man with long dreads. I'd later learn she'd painted it, and it was of her friend.</p>
    <p>This experience of fear being met with kindness was repeated often as I came to become their neighbor. I came back that night with a bunch of boxes, it was raining, and the only parking spot was directly in front 5 big dudes, nothing but black clothes/shoes on, staring me down as I pulled up.</p>
    <p>
      "Sorry if we're creepin' but we just gotta check out who you are." One guy told me when I got out. "You need help with these boxes?" The whole group started grabbing stuff and helped me and my girlfriend move it in. The first guy told me:
      <em>don't leave anything in the car, even these empty boxes, cause people will bop the window even if it just looks like maybe something.</em> His name was Bam and he was living in a late 80s Chevy Cavalier in front of the corner store.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drove past Mead Ave when I was moving to San Francisco this last spring. After 5 years of getting told
      <em>I was not a good fit for the role at this time</em>(because I don't have a degree) I'd finally landed a full-time gig at a serious tech company and could afford to walk to work.

      As I turned off San Pablo, I noticed the brick wall with the Super Mario street-art, one of many owned by

      <strong>Please vote</strong>, don't misunderstand me: we need the written evidence of the voters' intentions, and we as a country need to notice what police and federal troops do at the polls, as this is our canary in the coal mine. (Although, a lot of people have been seeing dead birds since the Patriot Act.)
    </p>
    <p>But this implicit rebuttal to the BLM call illustrates the SF Tech attitude toward BLM: use cleverness and intellectualism to drown out your obvious shame at being super rich while your country literally falls apart.

      Actually
      <em>looking</em> at things like the above is what professional white liberals are unwilling to do. They approve of BLM intellectually, but they're utterly terrified of being uncomfortable. What if I lose my job? How will I feed my kids? I'll have no healthcare!

    <p>This is the exact horror show that POC and their children are faced with right now (and have been since Manifest Destiny) and it's why they need our help. People here come out and protest on Saturday cause it's a nice way to get some sun after work all week. It is a fashion statement. There is no sacrifice.</p>

      This footage has been screaming for justice on YouTube since 2010, but suddenly now that the windows are finally breaking, we're to believe that these universally palatable men, with their arms folded playfully and who have the personal wealth of
      <strong>nation-states,</strong>are heartbroken and doing
      <em>everything they can</em> to stop what easily falls under the label of Genocide. People are touchy about this word because it obligates them to act, unequivocally, so let's be clear: nobody should feel good about grabbing a hard seltzer and binging Tiger King right now. You have been blessed with unfathomable freedom and wealth, not just within the US but on the world stage. Do you feel no sense of duty to the helpless being shot and strangled and burned and starved? Are you really OK with turning up the volume on Netflix so you don't hear them sobbing anymore?

      This farce of concern from VC Unicorns is one of the reasons I'm so bitter and high-strung all the time. I've actually lost friendships because people get tired of hearing me rant. I'll hear McConnell say about 5 words and I'm tweaking the whole night; I can
      <em>feel</em>that voice. This is not just some Story on the Feed for me. It is a constant droning agony in my heart that makes me want to punch windows.
    </p>
    <p>We had shootings a lot on Mead, usually nobody hits anything. But when they do, you can tell: everything is totally still and silent, because whoever was outside is dead. This lasts for a few seconds before the tires peel out, then each porches' front door opening and each neighbor looking down to see the 2 bodies on the corner by the Boys &amp; Girls club, totally still. We are making a heartbreaking but somehow familiar procession to keep watch until OPD throws up the tape.</p>
    <p>This might have been just another bad night, blurred impossibly with all the others.</p>
    <p>Coming the other way is a kid, maybe 13, slick with tears and sobbing as he states very plainly: "Now I gotta go tell my mama my big brother is dead."</p>
    <p>A few minutes later we hear her screaming the way only a mother who has just lost her young son can. The kid has stopped crying and is acting full man now, before he can drive, taking her by the arm and telling her it's ok while they go to ID the body. She keeps just keeps saying "no no no no no no no no" until she sees the body, then it's a sound I can't type.</p>
    <p>I don't think about this often because I can't. This was by far the worst night, but things like this happened so often in Oakland that I actually watched the adrenaline response in my body adapt to gunshots: at first they made my heart race, by the end I often didn't notice until someone else mentioned it.</p>
    <p>What's most memorable about Mead Ave is that despite this, it's the best place I've ever lived. I knew every single neighbor on the block because they'd each taken the time to come over and introduce themselves. I never worried about anything happening to my car or house, because my neighbors were always around keeping an eye out. Raymond next-door was a DJ who played everything from Marvin Gaye to Michael Jackson to Biggie. On Friday night, we'd just wander between peoples porches and yards and play music from the car. This is business as usual in their community, but for me after 18 years in a suburb where everybody is hidden quietly away behind ornate fencing, it was totally magical and insane.</p>

    <p>White professionals in Silicon Valley need to stop enabling these smiling VC thespians by pretending this economy isn't absolutely sick. Before COVID hit I was working at startup that provided dinner, and every night POC twice my age would haul big heavy racks of food up the elevator and serve me. White Liberals don't really have radar for when everybody light-skinned in the room is in a nice hip outfit and anybody a shade too dark is in a uniform with the logo of the company they work for. Whenever I'd make a comment about this I was met with total shock and silence. There was usually some appeal like "Well I'm glad for the thing Executives/Leadership said about it today at the town hall."</p>
    <p>
      What
      <em>did</em> ELT say about BLM? This is not verbatim, but at that company, it was to the effect of: "Look, this isn't even about politics. It's just good business. Our customers want it, the team wants it, it's a win-win-win."
    </p>
    <p>
      This is VCs answer to BLM:
      <em>Thank God black rights are #trending right now so we can appear to sacrifice while our TAM remains unscathed.</em>
    </p>
    <p>NASDAQ has continued to see record gains in the face of absolute tragedy worldwide. This should make us all deeply disturbed. It is hard, numerical proof that the diversity and inclusion efforts, so proudly broadcast by sf bay area tech startups, are tokenism: nobody has any intention of losing a single dollar about this.</p>
    <p>
      This pathological blood-thirst for money is further evidenced by their continued willingness to do billion-dollar-business with Russia and China.

    <p>
      I am 100% deadass about the following: if you are a
      <strong>white male who leads a team for a VC-funded company in Silicon Valley</strong>, tell ELT/Founders/Angels/etc:
      <strong>no more OKRs, no more Zoom or Slack or Jira.</strong>Tell anyone working under you that
      <strong>Black Lives Matter</strong>, then tell them to
      <strong>turn their laptops off</strong> until Gavin Newsom and CA Assembly/Senate pass legislation creating a
      <strong>publicly-appointed Overseer/Auditor for Law Enforcement</strong>, similar to OSHA/Food Safety inspectors. All PD / Sheriffs in the State of CA would be required to submit an annual report, covering shooting deaths, excessive force complaints, etc. The Overseer and a small staff would then
      <strong>audit these reports and surface any issues</strong> to the Assembly, the Senate, and the Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell your team to direct any questions from leadership to you, and stop assigning tasks. Make sure ELT knows you are a true leader, and that
      <strong>their beef is with you.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      POC need
      <strong>real proof from the white professional community</strong> that
      <strong>we stand in solidarity with the BLM protests,</strong>and we never stop thinking about
      <strong>Oscar Grant, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Walter Scott, Philando Castile, Nia Wilson</strong>, and now
      <strong>Breonna Taylor, George Floyd</strong>, and the hundreds of
      <strong>sisters</strong> and
      <strong>brothers</strong> and
      <strong>cousins</strong> that continue to be taken by violence every year without a headline or a protest.

        <strong>Slack / Jira / Instagram</strong>etc. suffer no damage from being turned off for a few months.
      </li>
      <li>The massive concentration of capital in these companies has allowed them to continue profiting while the majority of us on earth are struggling to breathe in the most real sense.</li>
      <li>
        We control this capital. The second we
