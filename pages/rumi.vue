<div class="flex flex-col justify-center items-center all">
<p>Don't unstring the bow.</p>
<p>I am your four-feathered arrow</p>
<p>that has not been used yet.</p>
<p>I am a strong knifeblade word,</p>
<p>not some if or maybe, dissolving in air.</p>
<p>I am sunlight slicing the dark.</p>
<p>Who made this night?</p>
<p>A forge deep in the earth-mud.</p>

<p>What is the body? Endurance.</p>
<p>What is love? Gratitude.</p>
<p>What is hidden in our chests? Laughter.</p>
<p>What else? Compassion.</p>

<p>Let the beloved be a hat pulled down firmly on my head.</p>
<p>Or drawstrings pulled and tied around my chest.</p>

<p>Someone asks, How does love have hands and feet?</p>
<p>Love is the sprouting bed for hands and feet!</p>
<p>Your father and mother were playing love games.</p>
<p>They came together, and you appeared!</p>

<p>Do not ask what love can make or do!</p>
<p>Look at the colors of the world.</p>
<p>The riverwater moving in all rivers at once.</p>
<p>The truth that lives in Shams' face.</p>
