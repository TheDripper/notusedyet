          When WordPress began in 2003, <span class="magenta">The Internet</span> was still largely <span class="magenta">uncolonized</span> and thus inhabited by <span class="magenta">nerds</span>. Back then, the WordPress mission
          <span class="magenta"><strong>to create a free and open source publishing platform for The Internet</strong></span> seemed like <span class="magenta">esoteric gibberish</span> to anybody who wasn't actively publishing or reading content, i.e. not that many people when compared to our current <span class="magenta">COVID era</span>, where the maintenance of our physical bodies is the last thing that hasn't yet been <span class="magenta">abstracted to an online software layer</span>. I pray that this last citadel of <span class="magenta">sweat</span> and <span class="magenta">poop</span> and <span class="magenta">hair</span> remains ours forever, <span class="magenta">amen.</span>

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>As usual, we're lucky the nerds had a head-start before business moved in. If begun just this year, in today's economic climate, the WP mission would be considered quixotic or maybe even <span class="magenta">terrorism</span>. This is tragic because it is this very potential to share new information at no cost that inspired the <span class="magenta">real heroes</span> to first design this virtual space we've now all taken <span class="magenta">refuge</span> in:</p>

        <p>These men are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=starving&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS847US847&oq=starving&aqs=chrome..69i57&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">starving</a> after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers" target="_blank">'08 crash</a> cut short the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_Devils_Are_Here" target="_blank">Housing/Derivatives/CDO casino</a>.

         <p>Suddenly the <span class="magenta">wolf pack</span> whiffs the unmistakable <span class="magenta">lemon-fresh</span> scent of <span class="magenta">fast money</span> being made in <span class="magenta">large quantities</span>. It seems to be coming from the <span class="magenta">Bay Area</span>.</p>
        <p>Here's the plan:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Pick a <span class="magenta">basic</span> feature of <span class="magenta">any society</span>, e.g.
            <ul>
              <li>a board in the town square to <span class="magenta">post</span> announcements</li>
              <li>an open <span class="magenta">marketplace</span> for vendors to sell</li>
              <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency" target="_blank">coins</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><span class="magenta">Abstract</span> these <span class="magenta">fundamental</span> concepts of human <span class="magenta">culture</span> that are <span class="magenta">thousands of years old</span> into an <span class="magenta">online software layer.</span>
          Use 
           with programming languages you've inherited for free from the prior scientific research of the US GOVT.- by writing some basic functions to handle trivial, age-old Comp Sci / Web Dev concerns like:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Posting an image to a server</li>
            <li>Posting a string of text to a chat</li>
            <li>Processing a credit card transaction</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Copywrite this curation of public work as "software" that you have "designed"</li>
          <li>Use this as legal justification to collect a tariff on every human heartbeat while you scroll instagram for things to spend your obscene wealth on.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There is no genius here, just <span class="magenta">young white men</span> cashing in on the basic movements of life itself.</p>

          Behold: a band of wild investors, drunk with bloodthirst for their next <span class="magenta">unicorn</span>, slaps a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" target="_blank">SaaS</a> padlock on progress and begins an amphetaminic <span class="magenta">hype ritual</span> with <span class="magenta">bright colors</span> and cute <span class="magenta">cartoon</span> characters and a whole quasi-magical language of metaphor and imagery to obfuscate the fact that they’re just reselling a <span class="magenta">spreadsheet</span>, or some <span class="magenta">scripts</span> to pipe data from Vendor A to Vendor B. These technologies were <span class="magenta">invented in the 70s</span>, but only recently has Wall Street figured out that you can box these things up with bright branding, deploy them to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Bezos-net</a>, and charge <span class="magenta">VC-funded</span> companies $1000/month "<span class="magenta">for the service</span>".

          If you are a small business, non-profit, or activist group looking to begin or update your digital presence, WordPress is the best option because it’s been used and tested by millions for the last 17 years and costs $0/month. You may still have to pay a developer for the time/labor of getting your templates and plugins configured, but there are
          <strong>no SaaS-y annual contracts or monthly fees to run the WP core.</strong> Lots of free or cheap plugins serving all common business needs, and at most you're paying a WP dev an hourly rate for a few hours of their time, instead of spending weeks in meetings trying to scope a budget with an agency. Thanks to the recent
          <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/">Gutenberg</a> updates, along with the
          <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/">REST API</a>, and the awesome work by the contributors on
          <a href="https://github.com/jaredpalmer/presspack" target="_blank">PressPack</a> we can now use modern build tools like Node Package Manager, Webpack, and PostCSS to make WP as powerful an option as any other platform on the web today.
