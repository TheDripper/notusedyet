        <p>As I write code for $$$ in the VC-funded horse-race that is the Tech Industry in 2020, I've been reflecting on one quiet but radical protestor who is out in the parking lot, handing out free copies of the good book: WordPress.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          When WordPress began in 2003, The Internet was still largely uncolonized and thus inhabited by nerds. Back then, the WordPress mission
          <strong>to create a free and open source publishing platform for The Internet</strong> seemed like esoteric gibberish to anybody who wasn't actively publishing or reading content, i.e. not that many people when compared to our current COVID era, where the maintenance of our physical bodies is the last thing that hasn't yet been abstracted to an online software layer. I pray that this last citadel of sweat and poop and hair remains ours forever, amen.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>As usual, we're lucky the nerds had a head-start before business moved in. If begun just this year, in today's economic climate, the WP mission would be considered quixotic or maybe even terrorism. This is tragic because it is this very potential to share new information at no cost that inspired the real heroes to first design this virtual space we've now all taken refuge in:</p>

        <p>Act 2: Enter The Business Schools of America, and their hordes of young white men who want to make a lot of money really fast.</p>
        <p>These men are starving after the '08 crash cut short the Housing/Derivatives/CDO casino. They are twitching and stuck in a stagnant economy with nothing but slow, stable bonds. Suddenly they whiff the unmistakable lemon-fresh scent of fast money being made in large quantities. It seems to be coming from the Bay Area.</p>
        <p>Here's the plan:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Pick a basic feature of any society, e.g.
            <ul>
              <li>a board in the town square to post announcements</li>
              <li>an open marketplace for vendors to sell</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Abstract these fundamental concepts of human culture that are thousands of years old into an online software layer- with programming languages you've inherited for free from the prior scientific research of the US GOVT.- by writing some basic functions to handle trivial, age-old Comp Sci / Web Dev concerns like:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Posting an image to a server</li>
            <li>Posting a string of text to a chat</li>
            <li>Processing a credit card transaction</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Copywrite this curation of public work as "software" that you have "designed"</li>
          <li>Use this as legal justification to collect a tariff on every human heartbeat while you scroll instagram for things to spend your obscene wealth on.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There is no genius here, just young white men cashing in on the basic movements of life itself.</p>

          Behold: a band of wild investors, drunk with bloodthirst for their next unicorn, slaps a SaaS padlock on progress and begins an amphetaminic hype ritual with bright colors and cute cartoon characters and a whole quasi-magical language of metaphor and imagery to obfuscate the fact that they’re just reselling a spreadsheet, or some scripts to pipe data from Vendor A to Vendor B. These technologies were invented in the 80s, but only recently has Wall Street figured out that you can box these things up with bright branding, deploy them to the Bezos-net, and charge VC-funded companies $1000/month "for the service".

          If you are a small business, non-profit, or activist group looking to begin or update your digital presence, WordPress is the best option because it’s been used and tested by millions for the last 17 years and costs $0/month. You may still have to pay a developer for the time/labor of getting your templates and plugins configured, but there are
          <strong>no SaaS-y annual contracts or monthly fees to run the WP core.</strong> Lots of free or cheap plugins serving all common business needs, and at most you're paying a WP dev an hourly rate for a few hours of their time, instead of spending weeks in meetings trying to scope a budget with an agency. Thanks to the recent
          <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/">Gutenberg</a> updates, along with the
          <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/">REST API</a>, and the awesome work by the contributors on
          <a href="https://github.com/jaredpalmer/presspack" target="_blank">PressPack</a> we can now use modern build tools like Node Package Manager, Webpack, and PostCSS to make WP as powerful an option as any other platform on the web today.
