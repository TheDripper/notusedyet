I lived in Oakland for 10 years and about 1.5 of them was spent on Mead Ave. This was 2013, so the Bay Area Housing Crisis was seeing its first wave. I was getting freelance webdev jobs off craigslist by exaggerating my skills on Skype and then googling PHP syntax all night. I needed cheap rent.

At this point I was a 21 year old white kid from Burlingame, so the first time I turned the corner and parked on Mead, my adrenaline was surging. There were 2 or 3 clusters of big, tall, serious-looking black men, sitting on their porch or listening to music by their car. I got out and started looking for the address I'd found on the internet, and within a couple seconds a woman behind me shouted "Hey!".

I jumped and turned around, certain that I'd pissed someone off and they wanted me to go back to my side of town.

"You're gonna get a ticket if you park there, it's street sweeping today." It was an older lady in the top window of the house I'd parked in front of. I noticed the other window had a painting in it: it was a surreal and beautiful portrait of a man with long dreads. I'd later learn she'd painted it, and it was of her friend.

This experience of fear being met with kindness kept repeating itself. I came back that night with a bunch of boxes, it was raining, and the only parking spot was directly in front 5 big dudes, all black, staring me down as I pulled up.

"Sorry if we're creepin' but we just gotta check who you are." One guy told me when I got out. "You need help with these boxes?" The whole group started grabbing stuff and helped me and my girlfriend move it in. The first guy told me: don't leave anything in the car, even these empty boxes, cause people will bop the window even if it just looks like maybe something. His name was Bam and he was living in a late 80s Chevy Cavalier in front of the corner store.

I drove past Mead Ave when I was moving to San Francisco this last spring. I'd finally landed a full-time gig at a serious tech company and could finally afford to walk to work. The brick wall with the Super Mario street-art that Sullivan Management owned had a new message spray-painted in big radiant sunshine yellow letters: RIP BAM.

There's a poster in the window of the apartment across the street from mine: BLACK VOTES MATTER.

Princeton proved in 2014 that they don't.

Please vote, don't misunderstand me: we need the written evidence of the voters' intentions,  and we as a country need to notice what police and federal troops do at the polls, as this is our canary in the coal-mine re: (although a lot of people have been seeing dead birds since the Patriot Act.)

But this poster illustrates the SF Tech attitude: use cleverness and intellectualism to drown out your obvious shame at being super rich while your country literally falls apart. There's always some lengthy explanation full of high-concept words, which quickly turn to nonsense as soon as you MAXIMUM TRIGGER WARNING watch the police murder an innocent young black man live on camera. 

This footage has been screaming for justice on YouTube since 2010, but suddenly now that the windows are finally breaking, we're to believe that these universally palatable men with their arms folded playfully in their shiny suits, who have the personal wealth of nation-states, are heartbroken and doing everything they can do stop the violence.

This farce is one of the reasons I'm so bitter and high-strung all the time. I've actually lost friendships because people get tired of hearing me rant; I'll get worked up on just one press statement from a congressman and I can't calm myself down the whole night because this is not just some abstract thing for me, it is an unbearable pain in my heart that makes me want to punch windows.
